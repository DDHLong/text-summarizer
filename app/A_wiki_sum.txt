Repulsion and Attraction are relative to one another insofar as the One is taken either as the beginning or result of their mediation with one another. Because it is the nature of the One to be purely self-related, their relation to one another is in fact a non-relation, i.e., takes place externally in the Void. The latter is a relative relation between two Determinate Beings whereby they distinguish themselves one from another and in turn determine themselves as specific Beings based on this distinction. From the standpoint of the one One, then, there are no other Ones, that is, its relation to them is one of (a) Exclusion. Within Quality, however, Reality and Negation are still distinct from one another, are still mediated, just like Being and Nothing were in Becoming. As moments, Identity and Difference require each other and are bound up with one another: one term could not exist without the other. This (a) One in its Own Self, standing in negative relation to all its preceding moments, is entirely differentiated from each of them.
